'''loop is the way way to write code multipele times
if something is been repeated manytimes then we use loops
'''

#if we have to write the name of any word 10 times then writing it manually will take much time
# but if you use loop you can do same taks in few lines of loop
for i in range(0,10):  #last value will not be included in the range
  print(f"{i+1} hellow world")
